--- Comments (these lines are ignored by Type 68) ---

1st line: ID's for the NO openings (unique identifier, for compatibility with SimCad)

2nd line: slope of each opening (0 deg = horizontal, 90 deg = vertical)

3rd line: Azimuth of each opening. Convention is the same as for Type 16 
          0= towards equator, positive towards West. 
          In Northern hemisphere, 0=South, positive angles are clockwise (from South to West)
          In Southern hemisphere, 0=North, positive angles are counterclockwise (from North to West)

4th line: values of NS view angles (Evenly spaced values, must start at -180.0 and end at 180-step !). 

          The values are absolute azimuth angles (0 = facing equator, etc.)
          (positive values clockwise for Northern hemisphere)
          The number of view angles you can provide is limited by the maximum line width (1000 char by default)
          SEE THE NOTES ABOUT VIEW ANGLES HERE BELOW

Lines 5 to (4+NS): 
          Obstruction height angles for each view angle, opening 1

Lines (5+NS) to (4+2*NS): 
          Obstruction height angles for each view angle, opening 2

...

Lines ((NO-1)*NS+5) to (NO*NS+4):
          Obstruction height angles for each view angle, opening NO


NOTES: - Type 68 will adjust the obstruction height to take into account the opening itself 
         for view angles that are "behind the opening". E.g. for a vertical wall obstruction 
         height is 90 when abs(SunAzimuth-SurfaceAzimuth)>90
       - The first view angle should always be -180.0. The obstruction angle profile is entered 
         using a step-like approximation, so the obstruction angle provided for a given view 
         angle is kept constant between that view angle and the next given view angle. 
         You must provide values from -180 to (180-view angle step)
