<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="Install"></a>Installing and Launching the program</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The setup program has copied all the required files in the 
destination directory you selected.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">You can launch the demo by running &quot;SDHW-TRNSED.exe&quot;. Once 
      TRNSED is 
launched, you should click on OK to close the welcome dialog box. The program 
      will automatically open the SDHW-TRNSED.trd file.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial">What is TRNSYS? What is TRNSED?</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>TRNSYS</b> ('tran-sis') is a <u>TR</u>a<u>N</u>sient <u>SY</u>stems <u>S</u>imulation program with a 
modular structure. It recognizes a system description language in which the user 
specifies the components that constitute the system and the manner in which they 
are connected. The TRNSYS library includes many of the components commonly found 
in thermal and electrical energy systems, as well as component routines to 
handle input of weather data or other time-dependent forcing functions and 
output of simulation results. The modular nature of TRNSYS procides the program 
with tremendous flexibility, and facilitates the addition to the program of 
mathematical models not included in the standard TRNSYS library. TRNSYS is well 
suited to detailed analyses of any system whose behavior is dependent on the 
passage of time. TRNSYS has become reference software for researchers and 
engineers around the world. Main applications include: solar systems (solar 
thermal and photovoltaic systems), low energy buildings and HVAC systems, 
renewable energy systems, cogeneration, fuel cells. For more information, please

<a href="file:///D://MKuSEL/Trnsys/Trnsed/FCDemo/H2Demo20/sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys">TRNSYS website</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>TRNSED</b> is a stand-alone visual interface for TRNSYS. It can be freely 
redistributed and allows TRNSYS users to share their work with other persons who 
do not own a TRNSYS license or who do not understand all the details involved in 
a simulation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Solar Domestic Hot Water (SDHW) system consists of 
solar collectors, a storage tank with auxiliary heating, a controller for the 
solar loop and some piping equipment.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The simulation also includes Utility Components (Weather 
Data and Solar Radiation Processor, Load, etc.). </font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial">Simulation Parameters</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The TRNSYS models are often very detailed and require 
some technical knowledge to
modify their parameters. The aim of this TRNSED application is to allow users to 
modify a few global parameters (system location, yearly load, rated power of the 
different components) in order to get a feeling on how the system works without 
having to understand the detailed models. The detail level of required 
parameters can be adapted to the intended user of the simulation.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial">Simulation outputs</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The main simulation results are plotted during the simulation, and 
4 output 
files
are also created: SDHW-TRNSED.plt and .pl2 present a printed version of&nbsp; 
all the variables plotted by the online plotter. &quot;daily.txt&quot; and &quot;Totals.txt&quot; 
have integrated data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a href="#Top">Back to Contents</a></font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="SimSetup"></a>Setting Up a Simulation</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The simulations are set up entirely from input fields in 
the different tabs. In 
numerical value fields, you will type the value of a certain parameter, say the 
collector area, or the slope of the collectors. TRNSED will try to detect if a 
parameter that you have typed is out of range and warn you accordingly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a href="#Top">Back to Content</a></font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="Run"></a>Launching a Simulation</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">To launch a simulation, select “Calculate” from the TRNSYS menu at the 
top of the screen or press the F8 key. After a moment, an online display of 
system variables will pop up and your simulation will begin to run. At the end 
of the simulation, a message will pop up saying that calculations have 
completed, do you wish to exit the online plotter. If you click yes, the program 
will revert back to its input screen. If you click no, the online plotter will 
stay visible until you select “Exit Online Plotter” from the “Calculations” menu 
at the top left of the screen. Information on viewing and interpreting results 
is included in the &quot;<a href="#Results">Viewing and Interpreting Results</a>&quot; section of this document.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a href="#Top">Back to Content</a></font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="Results"></a>Viewing and Interpreting Results</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">There are a few different ways that you can see results from a 
TRNSYS 
simulation.  </font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Using the online plotter</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">Once a simulation has completed, you can click “No” when asked 
whether you want to exit the online plotter. With the online plot still 
displayed, hold down the shift key and move the mouse along the x-axis and the 
names of the displayed variables (at the top of the plot) will be replaced by 
their values. If you press CTRL-SHIFT while moving the mouse, only the values 
occurring at a time step will be displayed (i.e. interpolation will be turned 
off in the online plotter).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the plot is too complex, you can “switch off” variables from 
the display by clicking on their names. You might notice that some variables are 
switched off in the default configuration to make the plot more readable. They 
are greyed out on the display. Just click on a variable name to activate it 
again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can also zoom in the plots by selecting a 
rectangular area with the mouse (click on the plot to select the upper left 
corner and then drag to define the rectangle. The zoom window is created when 
you release the mouse button). In the zoom window, you can display the value of 
all variables for a given time by pressing shift and moving the mouse. If you 
click on an axis (time, left or right axis) a control box will popup where you 
can modify the axis limits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can also change the background color of the plot 
between black and white using the “Plot Options” menu. </font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Additional output files</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The plotted values are also printed to text files (.plt an 
.pl2, located in the destination directory). You can import those text 
files in any post-processing program for further analysis. Daily integrated 
values and wimulation totals are also available in &quot;Daily.txt&quot; and &quot;Totals.txt&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a href="#Top">Back to Contents</a></font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><a name="Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting the 
simulation</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">If ever you run a simulation and TRNSYS encounters a problem, it will display 
the message that “an error was found in the deck, please check the listing file 
for more information.” The deck is the TRNSYS input file and the listing file 
(.lst) is 
generated every time the TRNSED demo is run. There is a large amount of 
complex information in the listing file but the actual errors that caused the 
simulation to stop are likely to be printed at the very end of the file. The 
simulation log file offers a more condensed version of error messages and 
warnings. You can view the log file by selecting &quot;Windows / Log&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Most errors come from bad parameters or bad a parameter 
combination. You can try to solve the problem by reverting the last parameter 
change you made.</font></p>
